The xbio package provides a lightweight and extensible interface for
performing functional enrichment analysis of gene sets, supporting the
biological interpretation of omics data. It integrates multiple annotation
resources, including KEGG and other widely used biological databases, offering a
flexible and modular framework for analyzing diverse datasets across various
research contexts.

Designed with performance in mind, the package delivers the same level of
accuracy as official algorithms while achieving significantly faster execution.

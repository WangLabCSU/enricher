<!-- badges: end -->

The enricher package provides a lightweight and extensible interface for
performing functional enrichment analysis of gene sets, supporting the
biological interpretation of omics data. It integrates multiple
annotation resources, including KEGG and other widely used biological
databases, offering a flexible and modular framework for analyzing
diverse datasets across various research contexts.

Designed with performance in mind, the package delivers the same level
of accuracy as official algorithms while achieving significantly faster
execution.

Description: An R package designed to bridge functional
    relationships between biological processes through flexible and extensible
    scoring strategies. It enables users to quantify associations between two
    sets of processes—whether well-characterized, poorly understood, or
    both—based on gene sets, ranked metrics, or threshold-defined signatures. By
    supporting multiple enrichment and similarity-based methods, including
    over-representation analysis (ORA), GSEA variants, and rank-rank
    hypergeometric overlap (RRHO), 'xbio' provides a unified interface for
    inferring potential functional relevance, co-regulation, or shared
    biological roles. This makes it a powerful tool for functional
    interpretation, knowledge transfer, and hypothesis generation in genomics,
    transcriptomics, and systems biology.
